# SAHA Theme for OJS 3
## Background

This is a theme for Open Journal Systems that uses Bootstrap 4.0. It was designed for the journal SAHA (South Asian Humanities Archive).

## Credits

This theme is based on the [OldGregg](https://github.com/Vitaliy-1/oldGregg/tree/master) theme by Vitaly Bezsheiko, which I chose as a basis because it includes and incorporates Bootstrap 4. I (Andrew Ollett) have modified most of the templates and style files.


## How to use
